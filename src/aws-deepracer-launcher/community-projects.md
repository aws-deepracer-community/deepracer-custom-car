# Community Projects

If you create your own project, please email us at deepraceropensource@amazon.com and weâ€™d be happy to feature it on the [Projects](https://github.com/aws-deepracer/aws-deepracer-launcher/blob/main/projects.md) list.

## 1. DeepBlaster

*By [Chris Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-miller-6470751/), CEO of Cloud Brigade*

Use object detection models to identify objects and fire at them using a motorized toy blaster mounted on an AWS DeepRacer device. It extends the AWS DeepRacer hardware with a 3D-printed, servo-controlled rotating turret and custom bracket. An Arduino microcontroller controls the rotation servo, blaster flywheels, and ammo feeder motor over a USB/Serial link. A second camera can be added to the turret to allow the AWS DeepRacer device to scan 360 degrees for objects and fire at them.

**Project ideas:** Sending a robot to put out a fire, multi-tasking (navigate and fire a nerf cannon), competitive racing, strategic games.

**Device needed:** AWS DeepRacer or AWS DeepRacer Evo 

**Add-on:** Toy Blaster, Servo Controlled Turret, Arduino Microcontroller, 2nd Camera (optional)

## 2. DeepDriver

*By [Jochem Lugtenburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jochem-lugtenburg-8285b8141/), Developer at Relive, 2019/2020 AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup finalist*

Mimics a real-world car that starts and stops at traffic lights and stop signs. The logic for identifying different colors in traffic signals and detect stop signs was developed by combining various computer vision capabilities, including OpenCV image-processing functions and object-detection machine learning models. Currently the focus is on stop signs and the traffic lights. Possibilities for extension include training the car to stop when a person or animal walks in front of it and detecting and staying within the bounds of a lane. Possibilities for scenarios with multiple AWS DeepRacer devices on a track include driving slower if another AWS DeepRacer is in front of the car or overtaking other cars using the LiDAR sensor.

**Project ideas:** Multi-racer competition, autonomous vehicle, using AI for safety and perception

**Device needed:** AWS DeepRacer or AWS DeepRacer Evo 

**Add-on:** N/A

**[See Instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/jochem725/deepdriver)**


## 3. RoboCat

*By [Martin Paradesi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msrparadesi/), [Organizer of AWS Machine Learning Community: NYC meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AWS-Machine-Learning-Community-NYC/)*

Community project that leverages OpenCV image-processing capabilities to detect a mouse in the image from an [infrared camera](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DWWSWNH/) mounted on the AWS DeepRacer device. The infrared camera allows the RoboCat to detect the mouse in the dark and scare it away using a pre-configured action space with three actions (move forward if a mouse is detected, move back after previous action, and remain stationary).

**Project ideas:** Pest control, object tracking, and in-home safety

**Device needed:** AWS DeepRacer or AWS DeepRacer Evo 

**Add-on:** [ELP Camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DWWSWNH/)

**[See Instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/msrparadesi/robocat_ws)**
